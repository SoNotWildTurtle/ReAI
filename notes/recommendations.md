# Recommendations

- Add Pester-based unit tests for core modules, beginning with Logging.
- Validate environment variables during setup and provide sensible defaults.
- Introduce a centralized error handling module to standardize messaging.
- Provide a sample configuration file for quick project bootstrapping.
